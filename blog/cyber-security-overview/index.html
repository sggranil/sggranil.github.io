            <h3>I. Details of the event/activity</h3>
            <article>
                The Digital Defenders organized a webinar entitled “Cyber Security Overview” last December 6, 2022, 10AM to 12NN via Zoom Meeting. The resource speaker was Mr. Art Christian Navarro.

            <h3>II.	Reflections on the webinar/activity give rise to (learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                I learned that cybersecurity is a critical concern in today's world, as more and more of our daily lives and activities are conducted online. The ever-increasing reliance on technology and the internet has created new opportunities for individuals and organizations to be targeted by cybercriminals. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the risks and to take steps to protect themselves against potential cyber attacks. This can include implementing strong passwords, using security software, and being cautious about the information that is shared online. It is also important for individuals and organizations to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in cybersecurity and to be proactive in addressing potential vulnerabilities.

                He discussed about the CIA, or the Confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These are the three main principles of cyber security. Confidentiality refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized access, while integrity ensures that data is accurate and unchanged. Availability ensures that authorized users have access to the information they need, when they need it. Together, these principles help to safeguard against cyber attacks and protect valuable information assets.

                Then later discussed the different types of cyber attacks, but some common ones include malware attacks, phishing attacks, and denial of service attacks. Malware attacks involve the use of malicious software to gain unauthorized access to a computer or network. Phishing attacks use fraudulent emails or websites to trick people into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information. Denial of service attacks attempt to make a website or network unavailable to users by overwhelming it with traffic. These are just a few examples, but there are many other ways that cyber attackers can try to gain access to a system or disrupt its operations.

            <h3>III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                Sir Melner told us from his last discussion, since he’s our instructor on System Administration and Maintenance, it is very important to implement security in any aspects of cyber space, especially we are developing a web application that will used and upload in world wide web. It is important to have knowledge in different attacks so that we know how to prevent and implement several layers of security, just to protect the data of every individual. Mr. Art explained how to prevent our system from attacks, by implementing a secured antivirus, scanning emails which sometimes has malwares, and securing the URL.

            <h3>IV.	Positive feedback (on the event organization)</h3>
            <article>
                I would say that this webinar is worth my time. I learned various methods and other tips on how to implement my web application from several cyberattacks. I urged myself that time to have an overlook on different web technologies that are related to securing our website.

            <h3>V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities</h3>
            <article>
                I don’t have any suggestions because this webinar was very successful. I learned a lot from Mr. Art, kudos!
