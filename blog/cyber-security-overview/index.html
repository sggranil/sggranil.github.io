            <h3>II.	Reflections on the webinar/activity give rise to (learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                I learned that a web design is a crucial aspect of creating a successful online presence. It is the process of designing and building a website to effectively convey a brand's message and engage with its audience. And as such, there are a few do's and don'ts that every web designer should keep in mind in order to create an effective and user-friendly website.

            <article>
                One of the most important do's in web design that I learned and will adopt is to prioritize user experience. This means making sure that the website is easy to navigate and that the information is presented in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the website is mobile-friendly and responsive, as more and more people are accessing the internet via their smartphones.

                Another important do in web design is to use high-quality imagery and graphics. This can help to engage the user and make the website more visually appealing. Additionally, it is important to use appropriate fonts and colors that align with the brand's overall aesthetic.

                One of the biggest don'ts in web design that I will avoid in my future projects is to use too much text. While it is important to provide useful information, a website that is overly text-heavy can be overwhelming and difficult to read. Instead, it is better to use short, concise paragraphs and bullet points to convey information in an easily digestible format.

            <article>
                Another common mistake in web design is to use too many different fonts and colors. This can make the website look cluttered and unprofessional. Instead, it is best to stick to a limited number of fonts and colors that complement each other and align with the brand's aesthetic.

                In conclusion, web design is an important aspect of creating a successful online presence. By prioritizing user experience, using high-quality imagery and graphics, and avoiding excessive text and cluttered design, web designers can create effective and user-friendly websites that effectively convey a brand's message and engage with its audience.

            <h3>III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                One way to implement the learnings from the do's and don'ts of web design on a practical level is to regularly conduct user testing and gather feedback on the design of your website. This can help identify any areas of the design that may be confusing or difficult for users to navigate, and allow you to make adjustments to improve the user experience. Additionally, staying up-to-date on the latest design trends and best practices can also help ensure that your website is effective and user-friendly.

                I enjoyed the webinar on do's and don'ts in web design, I appreciated the practical tips and examples that were provided and the presenter was very knowledgeable about her topic. Overall, I found the webinar to be a great learning experience, and I am confident that I will be able to apply what I learned to my own web design work

            <h3>V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities</h3>
            <article>
                Although the webinar was a success, the organizers must enhance the flow of their program, and the master of ceremonies must engage their attendees as they wait for the event to begin
