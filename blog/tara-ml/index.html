            <h3>I. Details of the event/activity</h3>
            <article>
                The webinar that I attended was titled "Tara ML! A Zero-to-Hero Machine Learning Journey", conducted by Google Developer Student Clubs Philippines on December 7, 2022, at 1PM via Zoom. Mr. John Patrick Laurel, a data visualization analyst at TaskUs with experience in business analytics, data manipulation, and designing interactive dashboards, was the resource speaker.

            <h3>II.	Reflections on the webinar/activity give rise to (learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                I learned that machine learning has become increasingly prevalent in many different industries and fields, including social media, e-commerce, and the internet of things. In social media, machine learning algorithms are often used to personalize user experiences, such as recommending content or friends to connect with. In e-commerce, machine learning is used for tasks such as product recommendation and fraud detection. In the IoT, machine learning is used to analyze data from connected devices and make predictions or take actions based on that data.

                There are many different pathways to learning machine learning, but two common ones are theory first and engineering. Theory-first involves learning the underlying theory of machine learning models, as well as picking up one programming language and specialize on that. The second one is engineering which you can pick one programming language and understand enough intuition of some machine learning modules.

                The training set is a crucial part of the machine learning process as I remembered. It is the data that the algorithm uses to learn and make predictions. The quality and diversity of the training data can have a significant impact on the performance of the machine learning model. On the second part of his talk, he conducted a demo on how to manipulate data by importing the data set and I was amazed how he generated different predictions from other sample data sets he has. By using pandas and numpy (which both are python libraries), we could able to manipulate the data in order to make predictions.

            <h3>III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                By using machine learning algorithms, we can process and analyze large amounts of data in order to make predictions or gain insights that would not be possible with traditional methods. Most of the potential use of machine learning is in the field of healthcare, which all medical records and other data are analyze to identify patterns and make predictions about a patient's health; and transportation which could be used to analyze traffic data and make predictions about congestion and accidents, helping cities to optimize their transportation networks and reduce the likelihood of accidents.

            <h3>IV.	Positive feedback (on the event organization)</h3>
            <article>
                The GDSC webinar on Machine Learning was incredibly informative and engaging. The speaker did a fantastic job of explaining complex concepts in a way that was easy to understand, and the use of visual aids helped to reinforce the key points. I especially appreciated the real-world examples used to illustrate the potential applications of machine learning. Overall, it was a great learning experience and I highly recommend attending future webinars by GDSC. Thank you for putting on such a valuable and enlightening event!

            <h3>V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities</h3>
            <article>
                I don't have any suggestions because GDSC was well-known for the quality of their contents, and as the past president of CCS Student Council, GDSC has collaborated with us eversince.
