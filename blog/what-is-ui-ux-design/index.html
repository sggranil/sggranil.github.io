                Last December 18, 2022, Thinkful Webinars held a webinar entitled "What is UI/UX design?" at 5:00PM ETC, which was conducted by Mr. Dodge McIntosh, a community engagement instructor at Thinkful. The webinar aimed to provide an overview of the fundamentals of user interface and user experience design. It featured a discussion about the differences between UI and UX design, and gave attendees an introduction to the tools and techniques used in UI/UX design.

            <article>
                I have learned that UI/UX Design is the process of creating user interfaces that are attractive, easy to use, and intuitive. The distinct roles of UI/UX Designers include creating wireframes, designing user interface elements, and coding the interface.

                Another intake is that the process of a UX Design involves research and testing to ensure that a product is designed with the user in mind. Ultimately, this ensures that the product is the most effective and enjoyable for the user.

                Additionally, UI/UX Designers must also be knowledgeable of user testing and analytics to create a successful design. And also, UI/UX design is an important part of developing a successful product. It involves creating a user interface that is easy to use and provides a great user experience. The tools used for this process can vary, but some of the most commonly used tools are wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and usability testing.

            <h3>V. Suggestions for improvements to be made/consider for future activities</h3>
            <article>
                I have a few suggestions since I registered from Eventbrite, first is to offer a Q&A session with an experienced UI/UX designer to answer questions from the attendees because I noticed that they didnâ€™t open the chat section and provide an overview of the different tools used in UI/UX design, such as Sketch, Adobe XD, Illustrator, and such.
