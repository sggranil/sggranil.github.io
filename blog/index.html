            <h1>My OJT Experience</h1>

            <article>
                COVID-19, as we all know, has posed an unprecedented challenge not just to our public 
                health and economy, but also to all students and their institutions. While we may have been caught 
                off guard, we have devised strategies to ensure that proper and quality education is provided in the 
                middle of the pandemic. We should, as I expected, receive face-to-face training from the 
                corporation, but we've already found a means to do so from the comfort of our own homes.

                Our instructor, as I recall from my first training, was looking for photo and video editors 
                for the online commencement exercise. But before I could tell him I was interested, he asked 
                whether I would be interested in joining the committee, and I eagerly agreed. Even though I was 
                worried at first, it was a fantastic experience. I had a lot of fun with my other council officers who 
                were also on the committee, and I learned a lot about graphic design and video editing, as well as 
                how to handle pressure before the event.

                I got a call from my instructor again after four months. He told me that someone had 
                recommended me because of my web design skills, and they thought I would be a good fit for that 
                role on the CCS Website, so I accepted it without hesitation. But there's a catch: I need to 
                understand the Angular framework first. It took me a week to acquaint myself with the framework 
                using a little typescript, and I also prepared wireframes before we started working on the project.
                I had previously come up with a concept and design for the page I was given, and I was surprised 
                when they chose to use my template as the main design for the entire page. Even though I was the 
                sole junior developer on our team, it was an honor. It was also my first time being recognized for 
                the work we put into the website.

                CCS Week has returned! I wasn't expecting to be chosen to lead one of the teams when I 
                checked the announcements. I'm feeling a little under strain, and I'm always wondering if I'm 
                capable of leading a team like this. But I began to believe in my ability to handle such a large 
                number of people. I put my leadership skills that I gained as a student council officer and cadet 
                officer in 10th grade to good use. I began scouting each member, learning about their potential 
                and abilities, and placing them in areas where they excelled. That, I believe, is why we got the 
                overall rank. I also appreciate my mentor and adviser's support, as well as my members' faith in 
                me. It was a great journey.

                I just received another call from my instructor after a week. I accepted the opportunity 
                since they needed a video editor for the virtual launch of R3LAMP. I utilized the computer that 
                the institution handed me so that I could edit more quickly. I learnt a new ability in After Effects, 
                and I've already improved my motion graphics skills, which is why the final product is so beautiful 
                and professional.

                In the last six months, I've gained a lot of experience, mostly in web programming and 
                video editing. I am grateful to my instructor, who has put his faith in me on numerous occasions, 
                for providing me with numerous possibilities to assist our institution, and I will continue to serve 
                Gordon College until I graduate.
