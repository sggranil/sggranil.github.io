            <article>
                I was the master of ceremonies for this event, something I've done numerous times previously. I confess that I stammer due of the long-term effects of neuropathy, but I'm not worried about it.

                I learned how Flexbox was used to create a responsive layout, and how to use it to create a grid system. I also learned how to create an effective navigation bar and how to style elements and grids with Flexbox. Mr. Diestro was an excellent speaker and his explanations were clear and concise.

                He also provided a demo of the code and showed us how to implement the layout in real-time. I found this webinar to be very helpful and it gave me a better understanding of how to use Flexbox to create responsive layouts.

                My experience with using flexbox in CSS was an enlightening one. I learned how to use flexbox to create responsive and dynamic layouts that are both versatile and efficient. I was able to apply it to my project and saw the immediate benefits of using flexbox for dynamic layouts.

            <article>
                I also learned a lot from Mr. Diestro's talk regarding flexbox. He gave us a comprehensive overview of the features and capabilities of flexbox, as well as the best practices for using it. He also shared his own experiences with using flexbox and gave us valuable tips on how to use it effectively. His talk was very informative and gave me a better understanding of how to use flexbox on my own projects.

            <h3>IV.	Positive feedback (on the event organization)</h3>
            <article>
                For the webinar Introduction to Bootstrap, I have done extensive preparation to ensure a successful and informative session. I have prepared a PowerPoint presentation with detailed explanations and visual examples of Bootstrap's features, such as grids, components, and utilities. I have also prepared a demo website to showcase how Bootstrap can be used to quickly create a simple website. Additionally, I have put together a Q&A session to address any questions or comments participants may have.

                The presenter was knowledgeable and clear with their explanations, making the material easy to understand and apply. The webinar also provided a great introduction to the basics of responsive design and Flexbox, which was incredibly helpful. I would definitely recommend this webinar to anyone looking to learn more about web development.
