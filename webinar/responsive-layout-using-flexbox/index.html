            <h1>Y4IT (Day 3 Morning Session)</h1>

            <h3>I. Details of the event/activity</h3>
            <article>
                The Youth for Information Technology is an annual IT event hosted by the University of the Philippines Information Technology Foundation. Y4iT primarily targets college students, professionals, educators, IT specialists, and enthusiasts interested in the newest IT breakthroughs and more. I attended the 3rd day of the event which held last November 18, 2022 at 8:30 AM. Several speakers discussed their respective subjects. Prof. Ariel Betan, an Associate Professor from UP Manila, presented Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, Junee Tan Torres on Data Science, and Ms. Elie Fermindoza from ASUS talked the Benefits of Having a Powerful Router and Monitor.

            <h3>II.	Reflections on the webinar/activity give rise to (learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                I have also interest in Data Science, and it has been a trend for nearly a decade, and it assists businesses in monitoring, managing, and collecting performance metrics that can be used to improve decision making in a workplace. However, some trends are exploding and have an impact on our daily lives, and we should keep an eye on them because they may have a negative impact on society. Prof. Betan discussed seven new data science trends that will emerge between 2022 and 2025 and I was shocked when he mentioned that these seven trends were not obtained by surveys and questionnaires, but rather through data analytics by analyzing millions of online searches and it has its own algorithm that is used to gather all data.

                Deep fake tops the list of data science trends. It manipulates or creates information to represent someone else using artificial intelligence and machine learning through the means of a photograph or video of one person that has been altered to seem like someone else, but it can also be audio. This technology was used in other malicious activities. I also tried Python, and it is being used to build a variety of applications, earning it the second spot on the list. We all know that Python is one of the best programming languages for data analytics because of the multiple free data science libraries available, like Pandas, and it can also be used to develop blockchain applications. Other trends on the list include corporations hiring more data analysts, data scientists joining Kaggle, increased interest in consumer data protection, and AI developers combating adversarial machine learning.

                Mr. Junee Tan Torres discussed his journey on how he became a data scientist in an interesting and informative way. He described the steps he took to acquire the necessary skills, such as learning Python and R, as well as the importance of networking and getting involved in the data science community. He also highlighted the importance of having self-confidence and perseverance to reach his goals. His story was inspiring and showed that anyone can become a data scientist if they are willing to put in the effort.

            <h3>III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                The webinar input on seven new data science trends that will emerge between 2022 and 2025 provides some interesting insights into how data science will evolve in the coming years. One practical way to implement some of these trends is to start using Python programming language for data science projects. Python has become an increasingly popular programming language for data science due to its flexibility and ease of use. Additionally, Python has a wide range of libraries and frameworks that can be used for data analysis, machine learning, and other data science tasks. Therefore, leveraging Python for data science projects can help to stay on top of the trends and be well-prepared for the shifts in data science technology.

            <h3>IV.	Positive feedback (on the event organization)</h3>
            <article>
                I had the pleasure of attending Y4IT 2022 and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of speakers, topics, and discussions. I was especially impressed with the diverse range of topics and the way in which they were presented. The professionals involved were highly experienced and knowledgeable. The event was well organised and I found the networking opportunities invaluable. I would highly recommend this event to anyone interested in furthering their knowledge and experience in Information Technology.
