            <article>
                This webinar was a great experience for me as it gave me a comprehensive understanding of the possibilities of the Internet of Things, and I am very glad that this webinar is quite the most successful one because other students from different department from Gordon College, and other participants from other school showed interest in joining with Sir Paulo as he teaches how IoT evolves and used in other fields, especially in medical, and IT field also.

            <h3>III. Reflections on possibilities on implementing some of the webinar input on a practical level (practical application of learnings)</h3>
            <article>
                I found the webinar input on IoT to be very informative and helpful. It gave me insight into the possibilities of integrating IoT into my own projects with the use of Arduino as a beginner. I was particularly interested in the potential of leveraging existing infrastructure and the idea of using a "hub and spoke" approach to create an interconnected system of smart devices.
