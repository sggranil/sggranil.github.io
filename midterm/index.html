            <h1>TRANSACTION PROCESSING</h1>

            <article>
                The method by which an accounting system processed transactions of connected operations, such as the sale of goods to clients, the purchase of commodities and payment to vendors, the manufacturing of completed items for sale, and the payment to workers for services given, are known as <strong>Transaction Cycles</strong>.

                We have three different types of transaction cycles: <strong>Inventory Transaction Cycle</strong>, <strong>Sales Transaction Cycle</strong>, and <strong>Payment Transaction Cycle</strong>.

                The process of buying and paying for goods and services is known as the <strong>Expenditure Cycle</strong>, and it consists of a number of actions. These responsibilities include determining what has to be purchased, carrying out the actual purchase, receiving the supplies, and compensating the suppliers.

                The <strong>Conversion Cycle</strong> is the process of employing cash to generate goods and services, giving them to customers, and then gathering the related receivables and turning them back into cash.

                In accounting, the <strong>Revenue Cycle</strong> is a process that starts with getting a customer order or signing a contract with a customer, continues with providing an order to the client, and concludes with receiving money from the client.

                A <strong>document</strong>, which may also be used to begin processing transactions, records an economic occurrence. Some publications are produced via transaction processing. We have three types of documents: <strong>Source Document</strong>, <strong>Product Document</strong>, and <strong>Turnaround Document</strong>.
            </article>

            <article>
                A <strong>Source Document</strong> will serve as verifiable evidence that a transaction actually occurred, while the <strong>Product Document</strong> is the document that is produced as a result of the transaction. The <strong>Turnaround Document</strong> is the document that another system uses as a source document.

                Every financial transaction that a company makes is completely recorded in an accounting <strong>JOURNAL</strong>. It is sometimes referred to as the "book of original entry" since it is the first place where transactions are entered. We have two types of journals: <strong>General Journal</strong> and <strong>Special Sheet</strong>.
            </article>

            <article>
                A <strong>Special Journal</strong> is one that handles specialized transactions, such as sales or cash receipts. The use of customized journals significantly reduces the time required to record transactions and submit them to ledgers. Only transactions that occur frequently or regularly necessitate the use of special journals. The <strong>General Journal</strong> stipulated that all transactions must first be documented in a general notebook, except those recorded in specialist journals such as a cash journal, purchase journal, and so on.
